Explanation of changes:

General:
- Added a `flex flex-col gap-4` to the main container for better spacing between sections, replacing individual `mt-4`.
- Replaced hardcoded hex values with Tailwind CSS color names where applicable for better consistency and readability (e.g., `text-[#00d9d9]` to `text-turquoise-500`).

Title Section:
- Removed `shadow-xl` from the title container as it was redundant with the main container's shadow.
- Removed `w-full` as it's the default for block-level elements and often unnecessary in flex containers.
- Removed `mb-8` from the `h1` as the gap is now managed by the parent flex container.

Commit Grid Section:
- Removed redundant `shadow-xl` and `w-full`.

Explanation Section:
- Improved the text clarity and moved it into a `<p>` tag for better semantics.
- Removed `text-center self-center justify-self-center` from the paragraph as `text-center` is sufficient and the others are not needed in this flex layout.
- Simplified the list styling and removed redundant classes like `cursor-pointer` from the `span` elements as the `li` handles the hover effect.
- Ensured consistent spacing and alignment within the list items.
- Used more descriptive Tailwind color names for hover effects.

Overall Readability and Best Practices:
- Improved code formatting for better readability.
- Ensured consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes.
- Removed redundant or unnecessary classes for cleaner code.
- Improved semantic HTML by using a `<p>` tag for the explanatory text.
